    <Section>Bio
        <p class="text">I was born in a little town named Viedma in September of 1990. Always been
        interested in computers, and how they work. And my curiosity for it has started a journey
        of discovery that has led me to attend the WeCanCodeIt bootcamp in early 2023. Always
        a learner, I'm on the process of becoming a Junior Software Developer.
